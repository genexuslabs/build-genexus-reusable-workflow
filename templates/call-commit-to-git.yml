# -----------------
# Template that can be used by repositories on github.com/genexuslabs organization
# -----------------
# Requirements:
# * Your repository must have a workflow defined that publishes a new version of
#   component package(s) to a well-known feed on the organization (aka "build.yml").
# -----------------
# Instructions:
# 1. Edit the build.yml workflow file in your repository.
# 2. Copy the job "update-genexus-dependency" and add it to the workflow.
# 3. Configure your build job to generate package information (name and version).
# 4. Configure update-genexus-dependency job to execute after your build job and
#    retrieve the package name and version information.
# -----------------
name: Call Commit to Git Workflow

  jobs:

    # Your workflow must include a job that generates a new version of the componente (aka 'buildJob')
    # As an integration sample, the following 'buildJob' is provided.
    buildJob:
      name: Build & Publish
      # To ensure proper handling of values by the callable workflow, you need to define output variables.
      # In this sample, the values are saved as part of the step 'getDepsInfo'.
      # Please refer to the workflow itself for more information about the required and optional arguments.
      outputs:
        PACKAGE_VERSION: ${{ steps.getDepsInfo.outputs.PACKAGE_VERSION }}
        PACKAGES_NAME: ${{ steps.getDepsInfo.outputs.PACKAGES_NAME }}

      steps:
      # As part of your workflow steps, it is necessary to include a process that generates a new package
      # with a new version and publishes it to a well-known feed. During this process, it is important
      # to preserve certain values that will be used for integration purposes.
